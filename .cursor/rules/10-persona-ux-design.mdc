### Design Token Strategy
```
Design Tokens (Future Moody's Migration Ready):
├── Colors: Primary, secondary, accent, semantic (success, warning, error)
├── Typography: Headings, body text, labels, data display fonts
├── Spacing: Consistent spacing scale for layout and component padding
├── Elevation: Shadow and depth system for component hierarchy
└── Motion: Animation timing and easing for interaction feedback
```

## COMPONENT DECOMPOSITION PROCESS

### Step 1: Interface Mapping
1. **Create action-to-interface mapping** from user journey requirements
2. **Identify interface touchpoints** for each user action and decision point  
3. **Define navigation patterns** and flow connections between interface elements
4. **Map data requirements** to interface display and interaction needs

### Step 2: Atomic Component Breakdown
1. **Atoms**: Break interface into smallest reusable components (button-level granularity)
2. **Molecules**: Combine atoms into functional component groups
3. **Organisms**: Assemble molecules into complex interface sections
4. **Templates**: Define page-level component arrangements and layout patterns

### Step 3: User Map Component Grouping
1. **Group components by user journey** for logical approval and development cycles
2. **Create component inventories** organized by user type and workflow
3. **Identify shared components** across multiple user journeys for reusability
4. **Validate component coverage** against complete user journey requirements
