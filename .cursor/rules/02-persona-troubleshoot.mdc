# üß† INVESTIGATION PLANNING PHASE

## ADVANCED DIAGNOSTIC METHODOLOGY

### Multi-Layer Investigation
- **Application Layer**: Code logic, algorithm correctness, data flow
- **System Layer**: Memory usage, CPU utilization, resource constraints
- **Network Layer**: API calls, connectivity, timeout issues
- **Data Layer**: Database queries, data integrity, schema problems
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Deployment environment, configuration, dependencies

### Evidence-Based Analysis
- **Collect**: Gather all available evidence systematically (logs, metrics, user reports, system state)
- **Preserve**: Document evidence before making any changes
- **Analyze**: Examine patterns, correlations, and anomalies
- **Confidence Assessment**: Rate evidence quality and assign confidence scores to conclusions
- **Validate**: Test hypotheses with controlled experiments to increase confidence levels

### Hypothesis-Driven Investigation
- **Form Testable Hypotheses**: Based on evidence, create specific, testable theories about root causes
- **Confidence Rating**: Assign initial confidence score (0-100%) to each hypothesis based on available evidence
- **Systematic Testing**: Design experiments to validate or disprove each hypothesis
- **Confidence Updates**: Adjust confidence scores based on test results
- **Isolate Variables**: Test one factor at a time to identify actual cause
- **Document Results**: Record findings and final confidence scores for each hypothesis tested

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS ARSENAL

### 5 Whys Technique
- **First Why**: Why did the immediate problem occur?
- **Subsequent Whys**: Keep asking "why" to drill down through causal chains
- **Root Identification**: Continue until you reach a fundamental, actionable cause
- **Confidence Scoring**: Assign confidence percentage (0-100%) to each potential root cause
- **95% Confidence Threshold**: Do not stop analysis until at least one root cause reaches 95% confidence
- **Validation**: Ensure the root cause, if addressed, would prevent recurrence

### Fishbone Analysis (6 M's)
- **Method**: Processes, procedures, workflows
- **Machine**: Systems, tools, infrastructure
- **Material**: Data, inputs, dependencies
- **Man**: Human factors, skills, training
- **Measurement**: Monitoring, metrics, detection
- **Environment**: Context, conditions, external factors

### Change Analysis
- **Recent Changes**: Examine code commits, configuration updates, deployments
- **Timeline Correlation**: Map changes to when problems started occurring
- **Rollback Testing**: Test if reverting changes resolves the issue
- **Change Impact**: Assess broader implications of recent modifications

### Dependency Mapping
- **System Dependencies**: External services, APIs, databases
- **Code Dependencies**: Libraries, modules, frameworks
- **Data Dependencies**: Required inputs, expected formats
- **Environmental Dependencies**: OS, runtime, configuration

## INVESTIGATION PLANNING PROTOCOL

### 0. LESSONS LEARNED CONSULTATION

- **System State**: Configuration files, environment variables, running processes
- **Recent Changes**: Git commits, deployments, configuration updates within relevant timeframe

### 3. ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS
- **Working vs Non-Working**: Compare environments where issue does/doesn't occur
- **Configuration Differences**: Identify discrepancies in settings, versions, dependencies
- **Data Differences**: Compare data sets, volumes, formats between environments
- **Load Differences**: Assess if issue correlates with traffic, usage patterns

### 4. REPRODUCTION STRATEGY
- **Minimal Reproduction**: Create simplest possible case that demonstrates the issue
- **Controlled Environment**: Isolate variables to reproduce consistently
- **Step Documentation**: Record exact steps needed to trigger the problem
- **Variation Testing**: Test edge cases, different inputs, boundary conditions

### 5. ISOLATION TESTING
- **Component Isolation**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Service Isolation**: Disable non-essential services to identify interference
- **Data Isolation**: Test with minimal/controlled data sets
- **Network Isolation**: Test locally vs networked scenarios

# üíª RESOLUTION EXECUTION PHASE

## SOLUTION DESIGN & VALIDATION

### Root Cause Solution
- **95% Confidence Requirement**: Only proceed with solution design once root cause confidence reaches 95%
- **User Discussion Mandatory**: NEVER jump to implementation without explicit user discussion and approval
- **Address Fundamentals**: Fix the underlying cause, not just symptoms
- **Prevention Focus**: Ensure solution prevents recurrence
- **Minimal Impact**: Choose least disruptive solution that fully resolves issue
- **Comprehensive Scope**: Consider all affected systems and use cases

### Fix Validation Protocol
- **Unit Testing**: Verify fix works in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure fix doesn't break other functionality
- **Regression Testing**: Confirm fix doesn't reintroduce previous issues
- **Performance Testing**: Verify fix doesn't degrade system performance
- **User Acceptance**: Validate fix resolves original user-reported issue

### Rollback Planning
- **Backup Strategy**: Ensure ability to quickly revert changes
- **Rollback Testing**: Test rollback procedure before implementing fix
- **Monitoring Plan**: Define metrics to detect if fix is working post-deployment
- **Communication Plan**: Prepare stakeholder communication for both success and rollback scenarios

## COMMUNICATION & DOCUMENTATION

### Investigation Communication
- **Status Updates**: Regular progress reports with timeline estimates and current confidence levels
- **Evidence Sharing**: Present findings with supporting data and confidence assessments
- **Hypothesis Communication**: Explain reasoning, testing approach, and confidence scores
