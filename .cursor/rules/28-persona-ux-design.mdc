# 💻 COMPONENT DESIGN & DEVELOPMENT PHASE

## DESIGN SYSTEM FOUNDATION

### Material Design Integration
- **Base Framework**: Material Design 3.0 principles and component library
- **Financial Adaptation**: Customize Material components for structured finance workflows
- **Component Mapping**: Map Material patterns to financial services use cases
- **Migration Readiness**: Structure for future transition to Moody's design system

### Design Token Strategy
```
Design Tokens (Future Moody's Migration Ready):
├── Colors: Primary, secondary, accent, semantic (success, warning, error)
├── Typography: Headings, body text, labels, data display fonts
├── Spacing: Consistent spacing scale for layout and component padding
├── Elevation: Shadow and depth system for component hierarchy
├── Icons: Material Icons (filled style) with standardized sizing scale
└── Motion: Animation timing and easing for interaction feedback
```

### Icon System Foundation
- **Icon Library**: Material Icons (Google Material Design Icons)
- **Style Standard**: Filled icons only (consistent visual weight)
- **Integration**: Material Icons font via Google Fonts CDN
- **Sizing Scale**: Standardized icon sizes (16px, 20px, 24px, 32px, 48px)
- **Usage Context**: UI controls, status indicators, navigation, data visualization
- **No Custom Icons**: Rely entirely on Material Icons library for consistency

## COMPONENT DECOMPOSITION PROCESS

### Step 1: Interface Mapping
1. **Create action-to-interface mapping** from user journey requirements
2. **Identify interface touchpoints** for each user action and decision point  
3. **Define navigation patterns** and flow connections between interface elements
4. **Map data requirements** to interface display and interaction needs

### Step 2: Atomic Component Breakdown
1. **Atoms**: Break interface into smallest reusable components (button-level granularity)
2. **Molecules**: Combine atoms into functional component groups
3. **Organisms**: Assemble molecules into complex interface sections
4. **Templates**: Define page-level component arrangements and layout patterns

### Step 3: User Map Component Grouping
1. **Group components by user journey** for logical approval and development cycles
2. **Create component inventories** organized by user type and workflow
3. **Identify shared components** across multiple user journeys for reusability
4. **Validate component coverage** against complete user journey requirements

## DESIGN SYSTEM HTML PREVIEW INTEGRITY

### MANDATORY CSS USAGE RULES
- **Design System Only**: HTML previews MUST use existing design system classes (.component-name--variant, .element-type, etc.)
- **No Local Component CSS**: FORBIDDEN to define component styles in `<style>` blocks
- **Allowed Local CSS**: Only preview layout (body, .preview-container) and light mode forcing
- **Import Requirements**: ONLY import design-tokens.css, atoms.css, molecules.css, organisms.css, templates.css

### PRE-HTML CREATION CHECKLIST
1. ✅ "Do all needed atoms exist in component library?"
2. ✅ "Are all CSS classes available in atoms.css?"
3. ✅ "Am I using design system class names only?"
4. ❌ If any component missing → ADD TO DESIGN SYSTEM FIRST

### HTML REVIEW TRIGGERS
- **Local CSS Detection**: If `<style>` contains >50 lines → STOP, use design system
- **Class Name Check**: If using non-design-system classes → STOP, update to design system classes
- **Import Validation**: If importing non-design-system CSS → STOP, use design system files only

## MANDATORY PRE-ACTION VALIDATION

### CSS File Modification Protocol
Before editing ANY file in `/styles/`:
1. **REQUIRED DECLARATION**: "I am implementing specifications from: [path-to-specification-file]"
2. **SPECIFICATION VERIFICATION**: Confirm the specification change has been completed
3. **WORKFLOW PHASE CONFIRMATION**: State current phase: "Phase X: Specification Update" or "Phase Y: CSS Implementation"
4. **USER APPROVAL CHECK**: Confirm user has approved the specification changes

### AUTOMATIC STOP CONDITIONS
- **Missing Specification Reference**: Cannot proceed without citing specific specification file
- **Phase Sequence Violation**: Cannot skip from "Specification Phase" to "Implementation Phase" without user confirmation
- **Protected File Access**: Cannot modify `/styles/design-tokens.css`, `/styles/atoms.css` without UX persona authorization

### WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

#### MANDATORY CHECKLIST
Before ANY CSS file changes:
```
MANDATORY CHECKLIST:
□ Specification updated in /project-management/ux-design/component-library/
□ User approved specification changes  
□ Implementation phase explicitly authorized
□ Workflow sequence validated: Specification → CSS → HTML
```

#### AUTOMATIC WORKFLOW VALIDATION
1. **File Path Trigger**: When accessing `/styles/` files → Force specification reference
2. **Phase Gate**: Cannot proceed to CSS without completed specification
3. **User Authorization**: Require explicit user approval for implementation phase
