## EPIC BREAKDOWN PROCESS

### Epic Development Workflow
1. **Create epic list** at high level without details
2. **Get approval on epic structure**: "Does this epic breakdown cover the theme?"
3. **Auto-generate epic folders**: `NNN-epic-name/` with sequential numbering
4. **Create epic templates**: `epic-details.md` and `stories.md` files
5. **Detail each epic individually** with complete specification
6. **Get individual approvals**: "Is this epic ready for story development?"

### Epic Documentation Template
- **Epic Name and Description**: Clear purpose and scope definition
- **Theme Alignment**: Explicit linkage to parent theme
- **User Journey Mapping**: Which journeys this epic supports
- **Business Value**: Priority ranking and ROI justification
- **Acceptance Criteria**: High-level completion requirements
- **Story Estimation**: Expected story count and complexity range
- **Dependencies**: Epic-to-epic relationships and sequencing
- **Risk Assessment**: Technical, business, and timeline risks

## STORY WRITING PROCESS

### Story Development Workflow
1. **Create story list** at high level without details
2. **Get approval on story structure**: "Does this story list cover the epic?"
3. **Detail each story individually** using hybrid context format
4. **Apply INVEST criteria validation** for Kanban solo PM context
5. **Define acceptance criteria** using checklist format
6. **Get individual approvals**: "Is this story ready for development?"

### Story Documentation Standards

```
As a [user type] in [context/situation], I want [goal] so that [benefit]
```

#### Modified INVEST Criteria (Kanban Solo PM)
